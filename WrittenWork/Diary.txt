- Since the start of term I have briefly looked around the topic generally. This involved briefly 
  looking at some research papers.

01/10/23
- In the past few days I have delved further into some specific papers. I will most likely use these
  to help construct my abstract.

04/10/23
- I have now started work on my plan for the final year project. I have almost completed my abstract, 
  but it just needs some further refinements.

08/10/23
- Since the 4th I have completed the project plan and handed it in on time. 

15/10/23
- Research conducted around basic chess logic and some simple algorithms.

22/10/23
- Some further research conducted but there is a lot to cover. Also delved into java concurrency.

29/10/23
- Creation of javafx for chess board. Pieces with pngs are added to the board and they can be clicked 
  on.

05/11/23
- Realised that creating chess from scratch in javafx has a lot of complications such as handling 
  mouse events. The creation of the game will take some time so is shelved until I have a further
  understanding of javafx, java and concurrency.

12/11/23
- New idea of creating TicTacToe first and making that program concurrent. This will allow me to
  get a better understanding of what is needed to complete chess. I aim to also implement This
  into my final product as you can then can play multiple different games.

19/11/23
- Preperation made for making the TicTacToe game. This involved researching into better methods
  available in javafx and research into the javafx.concurrent package.

22/11/23
- Functionality of TicTacToe is created. Very limited though as there is a board and you can set
  spaces on the board to either x or o. There is a turn system and a class that handles the possible
  ways you can win.

26/11/23
- Win system created for TicTacToe as well as animations to display this. 
- A method was created so that multiple games could also be played sequentially on the same board. 
  This is called after a game is finished.

29/11/23
- Lots of testing and bug fixes to account for them. 
- Implementation of a score system and the visuals on the GUI to display them. 
- Some comments were made on the code to properly explain some variables and methods. 
- Trial and error for concurrency started.

03/12/23
- More trial and error (obscene amount) in order to get concurrency working for the game. Now there
  are 2 instances of the game running at the same time. Also the game playing of the game is done on
  background threads independant of the Application Thread. This makes the app run a lot smoother and 
  the UI can actually be moved and work whilst other code is running. These 2 instances access this code 
  in a concurrent way sharing a lock. 
- Google checkstyles are also implemented with javadoc.
- Presentation started and completed.

06/12/23
- Presentation practice.

10/12/23
- Presentation performed and end of term.

17/01/24
- Start of term 2.


21/01/24
- Revisited goals and milestones for the project that i changed at the end of last term.
- Looked back over the chess code and thought how i would proceed.

24/01/24
- Realised some fundamental errors in chess application compared to TicTacToe. Done some research into
  ways to go about fixing this.

28/01/24
- Had meeting with advisor.
- Discussed my approach to the project and my next steps.

31/01/24
- Conducted deeper research into specific elements and javafx features that would benefit my chess 
  application development. 

04/02/24
- Ill and unable to make any progress unfortunately.

07/02/24
- Still unwell and just looked at some of the knowledge around the topic of creating a chat application.

11/02/24
- Developed understanding of chat applications and how they can be built in a java application.

14/02/24
- Planned the restructuring of Chess application. Significant progress made. With a much more advanced 
  understanding than before from research, this has become a lot easier to make chess.

18/02/24
- No work accomplished as had to focus my attention on another module.

21/02/24
- No work accomplished as had to focus my attention on another module.

25/02/24
- Began the planned restructuring of chess from ground up.

28/02/24
- Chess now implements a tile class somewhat similar to what was used in tictactoe. Additional functionality
  and some changed features were necessary.

03/03/24
- Started work on the write up as it is important to manage that side of the project also with the weightings. 

06/03/24
- Tidied up the main branch after realising i should have been working inside of the chess-game branch.
  Merging took substantial time due to some ugly conflicts that were very hard to deal with.

10/03/24
- Went back to work on my write up to ensure that it wont become a last minute problem. Time must be split 
  somewhat evenly.

13/03/24
- I unfortunately got very burnt out with work and decided to take a small break to regain some spirit.

17/03/24
- With new determination, I worked consistently to fix tile and piece selection. 
- Clicking a tile now highlights the tile and also shows a small spot on all of the empty tiles that can be moved 
  to (no specific moves yet).
- All opposing tiles that can be taken (all also) are also highlighted with a border that you would see in other 
  chess applications. 
- This is major progress for the chess application.

20/03/24
- HUGE progress made again. 
- Pieces can now move to the highlighted tiles. 
- There is a turn based system now in which white and black alternate. 
- Some small bugs were found in the piece movement system involving when taking a piece, the taken piece was never 
  actually removed but the taking piece instead was just on top.
- The piece class went under serious reconstruction and is now an abstract class.
- King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn classes were made. These inherit from the the Piece class. This allows
  for me to hard code the possible moves that each piece will be able to make on the board.
- A getMove method for each piece was created to acheive this which took the current tile being looked at and all of
  the possible tiles it could move to with its moveset. Ensuring to avoid indexOutOfRange errors and making sure that
  pieces blocking would be accounted for. 
- Pawns take diagonally but move forward, they can also move 2 tiles on their first move.
- Pawn promotion is now a thing although I haven't designed a interface to select which piece. I hardcoded instead that
  the pawn would automatically be promoted to a Queen.


24/03/24
- Took a step back and tested my code thoroughly. 
- Made sure to create a list of interesting chess mechanics that can cause problems and my next steps. This includes
  mechanics like en-passant, castling, pinned pieces and discovery. Check and CheckMate also will prove challenging.
