- Since the start of term I have briefly looked around the topic generally. This involved briefly 
  looking at some research papers.

01/10/23
- In the past few days I have delved further into some specific papers. I will most likely use these
  to help construct my abstract.

04/10/23
- I have now started work on my plan for the final year project. I have almost completed my abstract, 
  but it just needs some further refinements.

08/10/23
- Since the 4th I have completed the project plan and handed it in on time. 

15/10/23
- Research conducted around basic chess logic and some simple algorithms.

22/10/23
- Some further research conducted but there is a lot to cover. Also delved into java concurrency.

29/10/23
- Creation of javafx for chess board. Pieces with pngs are added to the board and they can be clicked 
  on.

05/11/23
- Realised that creating chess from scratch in javafx has a lot of complications such as handling 
  mouse events. The creation of the game will take some time so is shelved until I have a further
  understanding of javafx, java and concurrency.

12/11/23
- New idea of creating TicTacToe first and making that program concurrent. This will allow me to
  get a better understanding of what is needed to complete chess. I aim to also implement This
  into my final product as you can then can play multiple different games.

19/11/23
- Preperation made for making the TicTacToe game. This involved researching into better methods
  available in javafx and research into the javafx.concurrent package.

22/11/23
- Functionality of TicTacToe is created. Very limited though as there is a board and you can set
  spaces on the board to either x or o. There is a turn system and a class that handles the possible
  ways you can win.

26/11/23
- Win system created for TicTacToe as well as animations to display this. 
- A method was created so that multiple games could also be played sequentially on the same board. 
  This is called after a game is finished.

29/11/23
- Lots of testing and bug fixes to account for them. 
- Implementation of a score system and the visuals on the GUI to display them. 
- Some comments were made on the code to properly explain some variables and methods. 
- Trial and error for concurrency started.

03/12/23
- More trial and error (obscene amount) in order to get concurrency working for the game. Now there
  are 2 instances of the game running at the same time. Also the game playing of the game is done on
  background threads independant of the Application Thread. This makes the app run a lot smoother and 
  the UI can actually be moved and work whilst other code is running. These 2 instances access this code 
  in a concurrent way sharing a lock. 
- Google checkstyles are also implemented with javadoc.
- Presentation started and completed.
